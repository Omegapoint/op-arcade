# Bubbelt Trubbel
A cool game for op-arcade

Most positions are in radial coordinate system using radians.
Euclidean coordinates used for drawing and circle-circle and circle-line_segment collission detection.

## TODO
- more bubbles
  - different bounce rules
  - with hard shell that takes x hits before cracking
- radial walls that blocks bubbles
- combo: if you reach the roof, destroys the bubbles (too overpowered?)
- high-score table
- blood stains on bubble
