# Bubbelt Trubbel
A cool game for op-arcade

Most positions are in radial coordinate system using radians.
Euclidean coordinates used for drawing and circle-circle and circle-line_segment collission detection.

## TODO

  - one with different bounce rules
- radial walls that blocks bubbles
- game over and end screen with score
- high-score table
